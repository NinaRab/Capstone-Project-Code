Breeder Reserva Privada has taken the renowned sativa Maui Waui and crossed it with the mainland’s LA Confidential to create Haole, a pleasant, calming strain that is well-suited to relieve stress and relax body pains. Though its genetics are balanced between indica and sativa, this cross tends to express itself with more emphasis on its indica traits. The aroma is sweet and earthy and is reminiscent of Grandma’s spice cake. Reserva Prevada chose a Maui Waui mother due to its ease of growth and the consistent end product and then decided to influence the genetics with the manageable height, increased potency, and reduced flowering time of LA Confidential. The result is a beginner-friendly strain that is easy to grow and enjoyable for consumers of all experience levels.; Most Helpful macprincess 7/3/2015 9:32 PM 7/3/2015 9:32 PM “It's not my favorite.

Popular myth maintains that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush parented OG Kush, passing on the distinct “kush” bud structure we see in many strains today. However, we can’t be sure because OG Kush first came from bag seed in the early 90s. The earliest propagators (now known as Imperial Genetics) are said to have brought the seeds out of Florida to Colorado and southern California, where it now flourishes. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG. OG Kush is cherished for its ability to crush stress under the weight of its heavy euphoria. It carries an earthy pine and sour lemon scent with woody undertones, an aroma that has become the signature of OG Kush varieties and descendants. With OG Kush, patients most commonly cite improvements in migraines, ADD/ADHD, and stress disorders.; Most Helpful flyguywill 7/13/2011 7:28 PM 7/13/2011 7:28 PM “These nugs were dark and massive, fairly dense with a piney chocolate smell and covered in orange hairs and crystals.

1. Cheese 2. Earthy 3. Pungent,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/skunk-1,,,/hybrid/skunk-1,"UK Cheese is a popular hybrid strain known for its potent, balanced effects and signature musty cheese smell. The flavor is also unique with notes of berries and spicy cheese (one that may just have to be tasted rather than described). This strain is thought to be a specific phenotype (same genetics, different end result) of Skunk #1 that was originally cultivated in the early 1990s by a UK collective group known as “Exodus.” (As a result, this strain is also known as Exodus Cheese.) UK Cheese became popular for its energetic, euphoric head effects combined with its impressive pain relief potential. It quickly spread beyond the borders of its British home. Most users experience alert, sativa effects that allow for mental relaxation without sedation, but it may hasten bedtime for some. Effects tend to be felt in the head first, generally around the eyes, then spread throughout the entire body, producing muscle relaxation and even some tingly numbness. UK’s flowers are on the denser end of the scale and light green with a coat of orange hairs that would make both Prince Charles and Prince William jealous.; Most Helpful frazier71 3/21/2013 9:00 PM 3/21/2013 9:00 PM “One of my fav's so far!!!

1. Citrus 2. Pine 3. Grapefruit,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/haze,,,/sativa/haze,"Seattle Cough is a potent, sativa-dominant hybrid grown by Dutch Brothers in Washington. Its legend takes root from a clone of Dutch Cough, a sativa-led cross of Northern Lights #5 and Haze #2. In 1991, a small network of American growers, with ties to the original breeders, obtained a Dutch Cough clone from the prized mother plant in Amsterdam. As the plant migrated to North America the growers kept the Cough surname, interchanging the region or city it represented. Starting with Colorado Cough, the genetics spread northwest to include Seattle Cough as well as Canadian Cough. Seattle Cough (no relation to Strawberry Cough) carries a pungent mix of pine and citrus flavors. The aroma of fresh grapefruit serves as a precursor to the uplifting sativa effects, sparking creativity and dreamy euphoria. Medical patients appreciate Seattle Cough’s ability to curb stress and depression while fighting fatigue and nausea.; Most Helpful -Jeremy 10/2/2014 11:13 PM 10/2/2014 11:13 PM “70% Sativa dominant Seattle Cough has potent and powerful euphoric properties.
